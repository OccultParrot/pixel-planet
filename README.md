## Description

This project has been in my todo list for a *while*. I first got the idea from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe3CuOTc-sM), and really wanted to figure out how to write something similar for some practice with shaders (I LOVE writing shaders but rarely do).

It is written in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) version 4.4.1 and all the planet stuff (Except for rotation of the planet and clouds) is done entirely with the godot GLSL shaders.
